# Azathoth

My personal AI architect and development partner, designed to enforce high-level coding standards and automate complex workflows.

Azathoth is not just a tool; it's an opinionated AI agent framework. It serves as a collection of specialized MCP (Master Control Program) servers that encapsulate a specific, high-level development philosophy

Azathoth is the production-ready assistant. Its purpose is to act as an omnipotent partner in the development process, ensuring that every piece of code and every workflow adheres to a predefined set of best practices and personal standards.

## Core Features

This repository provides a suite of standalone servers that can be integrated with any MCP-compatible AI agent or CLI.

ðŸ§  Dynamic AI Directives (directives.py): Configure the core behavior of your AI assistant on the fly. Load master prompts for your core development philosophy, technology-specific mandates (e.g., Svelte 5 with Runes), or modes like the "Proactive Advisor."

ðŸ§­ Autonomous Code Analysis (scout.py): An intelligent agent that can explore a codebase, identify its language and stack, adapt to your preferred coding style for that language, and generate a comprehensive high-level report.

ðŸš€ Intelligent Git Workflows (workflow.py): Automate common Git tasks with AI-powered context. Includes tools for analyzing staged changes to generate conventional commit messages (autocommit) and for creating detailed, well-formatted GitHub releases (autorelease).

ðŸ¦€ Polyglot Foundation (Python & Rust): Core tooling is provided in both Python (mcp-py/) for rapid development and Rust (mcp-rs/) for performance-critical tasks, all managed within a unified workspace.
