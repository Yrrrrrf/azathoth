> My personal AI architect and development partner, designed to enforce high-level coding standards and automate complex workflows.

Azathoth is not just a tool; it's an opinionated AI agent framework. It serves as a collection of specialized MCP (Master Control Program) servers that encapsulate a specific, high-level development philosophy.

> **Note:** Azathoth is the production-ready assistant, ensuring that every piece of code and every workflow adheres to predefined best practices and personal standards.

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

### Installation

This project uses both Python and Rust dependencies. For Python dependencies:

```sh
uv sync
```

For Rust dependencies:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Quick Start

The Azathoth project provides a suite of standalone servers that can be integrated with any MCP-compatible AI agent or CLI:

1. **Dynamic AI Directives (directives.py):** Configure the core behavior of your AI assistant on the fly.
2. **Autonomous Code Analysis (scout.py):** An intelligent agent that can explore a codebase and generate a comprehensive report.
3. **Intelligent Git Workflows (workflow.py):** Automate common Git tasks with AI-powered context.
