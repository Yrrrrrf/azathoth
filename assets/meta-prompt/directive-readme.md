### **AI DIRECTIVE: Standardized README Generation Guide**

**Objective:** To generate a high-quality, professional, and visually consistent `README.md` for any given project. This guide outlines the mandatory structure, component patterns, and stylistic choices that define my personal development brand. You MUST adhere to these principles.

---

### **Core Philosophy**

Every README must achieve three goals:
1.  **Establish a Strong Visual Identity:** Immediately brand the project with a consistent header and badge style.
2.  **Ensure Clarity and Scannability:** Use emojis, concise descriptions, and logical structure to allow developers to grasp the project's purpose in seconds.
3.  **Provide a Low-Friction Entry Point:** Give users the exact commands and code they need to start using the project with minimal effort.

---

### **Mandatory Structure & Components**

A README file MUST be composed of the following sections in this exact order:

1.  **Header Block (`<h1>`)**
2.  **Badge Cluster (`<div>`)**
3.  **Overview Paragraph**
4.  **Getting Started Section (`## ðŸš¦ Getting Started`)**
5.  **License Section (`## ðŸ“„ License`)**

---

### **Component Breakdown & Guidelines**

#### The Header Block

This is the project's visual signature. It MUST be a centered `<h1>` block containing two elements:
- A `128x128` project icon (`<img>`).
- The project's name in a centered `<div>`.

**Markdown Implementation:**
```markdown
<h1 align="center">
  <img src="[LINK_TO_128x128_ICON.png]" alt="[Project Name] Icon" width="128" height="128">
  <div align="center">[Project Name]</div>
</h1>
```

#### The Badge Cluster

Directly following the header, there MUST be a centered `<div>` containing a collection of relevant badges. The preferred style is `style=for-the-badge`.

**A. Core Badges (Mandatory)**

- **GitHub Repository:** Links back to the source.
- **License:** Always specify the license (typically MIT).

**B. Package & Version Badges (If Applicable)**

- Include badges for any package managers the project is published on. You SHOULD also include download/metric counters where available.

**C. Informational & Status Badges (Optional but Recommended)**

- Include badges for versioning, CI/CD status, or powered-by technologies to provide at-a-glance project health.

**Example Badge Showcase (Use as a reference):**

```markdown
<div align="center">

#### The Overview

This section MUST begin with a concise, one-sentence summary of the project's purpose, often in a blockquote. It should be followed by a short paragraph (2-3 sentences) expanding on the core concept, its technology, or its place within a larger ecosystem.

**Example Implementation:**
```markdown
> A Python library for zero-configuration, OS-independent asset management.

Rune is a Python library designed to automatically discover and provide an intuitive API to access project files, eliminating the need for hardcoded relative paths.

> **Note:** This library is part of the Prism ecosystem, designed to create a seamless bridge between your database and client applications.
```
